# This repository contains the Python generator task of ALX Backend prodev.

## Python Generators Project

This directory contains resources and scripts for learning and practicing Python generators, file handling, and basic data processing.

### Contents

- **seed.py**: Python script to generate or process user data using generators.
- **user_data.csv**: Sample CSV file containing user data for testing and demonstration.
- **setup.sql**: SQL script to set up the database schema for storing user data.
- **load_csv.sql**: SQL script to load data from the CSV file into the database.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

### Usage

#### Python Script (`seed.py`)
- Demonstrates how to use Python generators for efficient data processing.
- Can be run to process or generate data for the CSV file.

#### CSV File (`user_data.csv`)
- Contains sample user data.
- Used as input for both the Python script and SQL scripts.

#### SQL Scripts
- **setup.sql**: Run this script to create the necessary database tables.
- **load_csv.sql**: Use this script to import data from `user_data.csv` into the database.

### How to Run

1. Run `setup.sql` in your SQL environment to create the required tables.
2. Use `seed.py` to generate or process data as needed.
3. Run `load_csv.sql` to import the CSV data into your database.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement Python generators.
- Practice reading and writing CSV files in Python.
- Learn how to set up and populate a database using SQL scripts.
